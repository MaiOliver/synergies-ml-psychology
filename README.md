# Exploring Synergies between Machine Learning and Psychological Theory Building 

This project aims to analyse data of swimming competitions for effect of team effort using different machine learning methods. The goal is to explore synergistic effects betweem established methodology in Psychology and the many tools and methods provided by machine learning.

## Notes on the structure of this repository
As some (`.csv`) files are fairly large `git lfs`("large file storage") is required to fetch these files. 
* `/data` contains original as well as cleaned datasets of the swimming competitions and results of the data analysis
* `/diagrams` houses figures and grafical representations of the results
* `/visual` contains exlusively scripts for plotting and visualizing data
